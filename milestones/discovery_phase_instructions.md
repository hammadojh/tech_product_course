# 📌 First Milestone Instructions: Discovery Phase

## 🚀 Objective
By the end of this phase, your team will submit a **Project Proposal** that includes:
- **Market Analysis & Problem Validation**
- **50+ Customer Discovery Interviews**
- **Value Proposition Definition**
- **Initial Product Backlog Creation**
- **Experimentation & Validation**

This phase is designed to **reduce uncertainty** and ensure that your team is solving a real, validated problem before moving to development.

## 🔍 1. Market Analysis & Problem Validation

### 🎯 Goal:
Understand the market landscape and **validate** the problem you are trying to solve.

### ✅ Deliverables:
- Market size estimation
- Competitive analysis (existing solutions, competitors, gaps)
- Problem statement with evidence

### 🔗 Resources:
> TODO: Add Resources: Finding a problem, why startups fail, .. etc.

---

## 🗣️ 2. Customer Discovery Interviews (50+ Interviews)

### 🎯 Goal:
Talk to **real potential users** and stakeholders to deeply understand their pain points.

### ✅ Deliverables:
- **50+ interviews** documented (summary of insights)
- Key findings & trends
- User personas (at least 3 personas)

### 🔗 Resources:
> TODO: Add Resources: The Mom test, User research methods, etc.

---

## 🏆 3. Value Proposition Definition

### 🎯 Goal:
Define what makes your product **unique** and why users will choose it.

### ✅ Deliverables:
- **Value Proposition Canvas**
- Unique Selling Proposition (USP)
- One-sentence pitch ("We help [user] solve [problem] by [solution]")

### 🔗 Resources:
> TODO: Add Resources: Value Proposition Canvas, .. etc.

---

## 🏗️ 4. Initial Product Backlog Creation

### 🎯 Goal:
Translate findings into **actionable product requirements**.

### ✅ Deliverables:
- **User stories** (minimum 10)
- **Prioritized backlog**
- Sketch or wireframe of initial product concept

### 🔗 Resources:
> TODO: Add Resources: SCRUM, User stories, .. etc.

---

## 🔬 5. Experimentation & Validation

### 🎯 Goal:
Conduct hands-on experiments with the technology you plan to build, ensuring feasibility and understanding technical challenges.

### ✅ Deliverables:
- **Proof of experimentation** (e.g., prototype, code snippet, technical PoC, hardware test, etc.)
- Key insights and technical feasibility evaluation
- Pivot or persevere decision based on findings

### 🔗 Resources:
> TODO: Add Resources: Rapid Prototyping for Tech Startups .. etc.

---

## 📑 Submission Requirements
- **Clear, structured presentation with visuals**
- **Team members' contributions documented**

## 🏅 Grading Rubric (100 Points Total)
| Criteria                          | Excellent (20) | Good (15) | Needs Work (10) | Poor (5) |
|-----------------------------------|---------------|-----------|----------------|---------|
| Market Analysis & Validation     | Thorough, data-driven, strong insights | Some analysis, minor gaps | Weak evidence, lack of depth | Superficial analysis |
| Customer Discovery Interviews    | 50+ detailed, well-documented insights | 30-50 interviews, some analysis | 20-30 interviews, weak insights | <20 interviews, lacks depth |
| Value Proposition Definition     | Clear, strong USP, validated | Defined but lacks differentiation | Vague, unvalidated | No clear value proposition |
| Initial Product Backlog          | Well-structured, user-centered backlog | Mostly complete, some gaps | Missing key user stories | No backlog or very weak |
| Experimentation & Validation     | Hands-on technical proof, strong insights | Basic prototype or proof, partial insights | Weak or minimal experimentation | No technical proof or validation |

---

## 🎯 Final Note
This phase is **critical** for your success. **Invest in research now** to avoid wasting months building the wrong product.

📢 **Talk to real users. Challenge your assumptions. Make data-driven decisions.**

Let’s build something impactful! 💡
