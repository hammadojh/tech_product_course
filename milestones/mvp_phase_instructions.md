# 📌 Second Milestone Instructions: MVP Phase

## 🚀 Objective  
By the end of this phase, your team will submit an **MVP Deliverables Package** that includes:  
- **Basic Landing Page & Sign-up** – a simple public page to capture user interest (e.g., email sign-ups).  
- **System Architecture Design** – a high-level design/diagram of your solution’s architecture and chosen tech stack.  
- **Wireframes & User Flows** – sketches or digital wireframes of core screens and the paths users take to accomplish key tasks.  
- **Functional MVP** – a working **Minimum Viable Product** implementing the **core features** of your solution (no extra fluff).  
- **Analytics Setup** – integration of analytics to track user behavior and key metrics (e.g., sign-ups, feature usage).  
- **Initial User Testing Results** – feedback and findings from testing the MVP with real users.  

This phase is all about **execution and iteration**. You’ll turn your validated idea into a tangible product and start gathering real user feedback. Focus on building the **most essential features** that deliver value to users – **nothing more**. Keep the product simple, usable, and be prepared to **iterate quickly** based on what you learn. Remember, an MVP’s purpose is to **maximize learning with minimal effort ([What Is an MVP?

## 🌐 1. Basic Landing Page & Sign-up Sheet

### 🎯 Goal:  
Establish an online presence and start **building a user interest list** even before your full product is ready. Create a simple landing page that clearly communicates your value proposition and includes a call-to-action (typically a sign-up for “early access” or a newsletter). The goal is to **gauge interest** and collect contact info from potential users. Keep it simple and compelling – enough to make visitors say “I want this!” and leave their email. This landing page can also serve as a quick experiment to validate demand (a form of MVP it ([The Minimum Viable Product Balancing Act - Lean Startup Co.](https://leanstartup.co/resources/articles/minimum-viable-product-balancing-act/#:~:text=A%20simple%20landing%20page%20that,product%20will%20eventually%20be%20sold))-L72】.

### ✅ Deliverables:  
- **Landing Page** – A live or mock webpage that highlights your product’s name, problem it solves, and core benefit. It should look clean and professional.  
- **Sign-up Form** – A functional email sign-up or “request access” form to capture interested users. Ensure submissions are saved (e.g., to a spreadsheet or email list).  
- **Value Proposition Messaging** – Clear and concise headline/tagline on the page that grabs attention and summarizes your solution.  
- *(Optional)* **Early Sign-up Count** – Track how many visitors/sign-ups you get (shows evidence of interest).

## 🏗️ 2. System Architecture Design

### 🎯 Goal:  
Design a **blueprint** for your product’s technical solution. Before diving into coding, map out the major components of your system and how they interact. This includes choosing your tech stack (e.g., web or mobile frameworks, database, APIs) and deciding on an architecture that can support your core features. The aim is to create a *“Minimum Viable Architecture”* – just enough structure to build and run your MVP reliably, without over-engineering. A good architecture plan ensures your team members are aligned on how the pieces fit together and can save you from costly refactori ([A Minimum Viable Product Needs a Minimum Viable Architecture - InfoQ](https://www.infoq.com/articles/minimum-viable-architecture/#:~:text=release%20that%20can%20be%20thought,so%20costly%20in%20terms%20of))53-L260】.

### ✅ Deliverables:  
- **Architecture Diagram** – A diagram illustrating the key components of your system and their interactions. For example, client-app ↔ server ↔ database, and any third-party services or integrations.  
- **Tech Stack Outline** – A list of technologies, frameworks, and tools you plan to use for each component (frontend, backend, database, etc.) with a brief justification. (E.g., *Frontend in React, Backend in Node.js with Express, MongoDB database* – chosen for team familiarity and fast development.)  
- **APIs/Services Listed** – Identify any external APIs or services necessary (e.g., Firebase, payment gateway, maps API).  
- **Scalability Considerations** – One or two notes on how the design could scale or be extended in the future if the product grows (e.g., “Using a modular monolith now for speed, can refactor to microservices later if needed” – keep it minimal but shows foresight).

## 📝 3. Wireframes & User Flows

### 🎯 Goal:  
Visualize the user experience of your core features **before** you build them. Create wireframes (simple schematics of your screens/UI) for the most important pages or screens in your MVP. Alongside this, map out **user flows** – step-by-step outlines of how a user will navigate your product to complete key tasks. The goal is to ensure the product’s layout and navigation make sense and to iron out any UX issues early. This planning will guide developers and help the team agree on what you’re building. Remember, **mapping the user journey is crucial** to designing intuitive and user-fri ([MVPs in UX Design: A 7-Step Guide | Maze](https://maze.co/blog/mvp-ux-design/#:~:text=5,wireframes))†L351-L359】.

### ✅ Deliverables:  
- **Wireframes** – Low or mid-fidelity wireframes of the main screens in your MVP (e.g., landing page, sign-up page, dashboard or main interface, any page to use the core feature). These can be sketched on paper or done with tools like Figma/Balsamiq – the focus is layout and content placement, not final visuals.  
- **User Flow Diagrams** – Diagrams or flowcharts that show the **path(s)** a user takes to accomplish primary actions. For example, a flow for “Sign up and create a profile” or “Submit a request”. Include decision points or key interactions (e.g., login success vs. error).  
- **User Journey Notes** – Brief descriptions for each flow explaining what the user goal is and how the design meets it. (For instance, “After logging in, the user is immediately shown their dashboard with summary stats, then they can navigate to X to do Y…”).  
- *(Optional)* **UI Prototype** – If possible, a clickable prototype (using Figma, Adobe XD, etc.) of the wireframes to simulate the user flows. This isn’t required but is nice for testing UX.

## ⚙️ 4. MVP Development (Core Features)

### 🎯 Goal:  
Build your **Minimum Viable Product** – the smallest functional version of your product that delivers your core value to users. This is where coding/development happens. Focus on implementing the **must-have features** identified from your backlog and wireframes, and nothing extra. The aim is to get a working product into users’ hands as quickly as possible to test assumptions in the real world. Embrace an **iterative mindset**: done is better than perfect, because you can refine once you have actual user feedback. As Eric Ries suggests, cut your feature list in half... then cut it  ([The Minimum Viable Product Balancing Act - Lean Startup Co.](https://leanstartup.co/resources/articles/minimum-viable-product-balancing-act/#:~:text=Eric%20Ries%E2%80%99%20shorthand%20guidance%20for,than%20what%20is%20actually%20needed))n to avoid gold-plating. In short, **build the core, skip the bells and whistles**.

### ✅ Deliverables:  
- **Functional MVP** – A working application (web app, mobile app, or other platform as appropriate) that users can actually interact with. It should cover the primary use case end-to-end. (For example, if your product is a to-do app, the MVP lets users create an account, add tasks, and mark tasks complete – core functionality achieved.)  
- **Core Features Implemented** – List out the MVP features you built (matching those “must-haves” you identified). Make sure each implemented feature clearly ties to solving the user’s problem you set out to address.  
- **Basic UI/UX** – The MVP should have a user interface that, while maybe basic, is usable and not confusing. It doesn’t need to be pretty, but it should be clean enough that users can navigate and use the features.  
- **Link or Demo** – Provide a way to demo the MVP: a link to a live site or testflight, or a recorded video demo if distribution is tricky. Reviewers should be able to see the product in action.  
- **Source Code Access** – *(Depending on course requirements)*, you might need to submit your code (e.g., GitHub repository link). Ensure your repo has clear instructions on how to run the app.

## 📊 5. Analytics Implementation

### 🎯 Goal:  
Integrate **analytics tracking** into your MVP to collect data on user behavior and product performance. Even at this early stage, it’s vital to measure how users are interacting with your product. You should set up tools to track key metrics (the ones that indicate whether your product is solving the problem and providing value). Examples include number of sign-ups, daily active users, conversion rates through a funnel, feature usage count, or any specific action tied to your hypothesis (e.g., if your MVP is a two-sided marketplace, track how many listings vs. purchases occur). The goal is to have **actionable insights** from day one – so you can base iterations on real data, not guesswork. Launching a product without tracking usage is l ([MVP Analytics: Launch Your Product With Insights](https://flatirons.com/blog/mvp-analytics-how-to-launch-your-product-with-proper-insights/#:~:text=We%2C%20at%20Flatirons%2C%20fundamentally%20believe,worst%20mistakes%20you%20can%20make))lind.

### ✅ Deliverables:  
- **Analytics Tool Setup** – Choose and implement at least one analytics solution (e.g., Google Analytics for web, Firebase Analytics for mobile, or more specialized tools like Mixpanel, Amplitude). The tool should be properly integrated in your MVP (e.g., the tracking code is installed and events are being recorded).  
- **Defined Key Metrics** – A short list of the key metrics you are monitoring. (For example: *“We track sign-ups per day, average time spent in app, and feature X usage count to see if users find value in X.”*) These should align with your success criteria or hypotheses.  
- **Event Tracking** – Implementation of custom events or goals for critical user actions (e.g., account created, item posted, purchase completed). This ensures you can later analyze the user funnel and drop-off points.  
- **Analytics Access or Screenshots** – Provide evidence that analytics is working. This could be viewer access to the analytics dashboard or screenshots showing some sample data coming in (e.g., a Google Analytics realtime user count, or an events log with your custom events).  
- **Privacy Consideration** – Ensure you are not collecting any personal data without consent. (At MVP stage, analytics should focus on usage metrics, not sensitive info.)

## 🧪 6. Initial User Testing

### 🎯 Goal:  
Test your MVP with **real users** and gather feedback. This is where you validate whether the product actually solves the user’s problem and is easy to use. Conduct a round of user testing by getting your MVP into the hands of a small number of target users (could be friendly early adopters or people recruited from your customer discovery). Observe them using the product, ask questions, and collect both qualitative feedback (comments, frustrations, likes) and quantitative data (from your analytics). The goal is to identify any usability issues, gauge user satisfaction, and discover improvements or feature gaps while the product is still **flexible**. Remember to keep the test group small and iterative – you don’t need hundreds of users yet; even **testing with 5 users** can uncover the majority  ([Why You Only Need to Test with 5 Users](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/why-you-only-need-to-test-with-5-users/#:~:text=Summary%3A%C2%A0%20Elaborate%20usability%20tests%20are,tests%20as%20you%20can%20afford)) issues.

### ✅ Deliverables:  
- **Test Plan & Participants** – A brief description of how you conducted user testing: how many users did you test with, who are they (e.g., target demographic or segment), and what scenarios or tasks you asked them to perform. (For example: “Tested with 5 university students who regularly use budgeting apps. Each was asked to sign up, create a budget, and add an expense, while thinking aloud.”)  
- **Observations & Feedback** – Summarize the key observations from the sessions. What problems did users encounter? What questions did they ask? Note any recurring issues or insightful comments. Both positive feedback (“I love that it does X”) and negative (“I got confused at Y”) are useful.  
- **Issue List or Bug Report** – List the usability problems or bugs discovered. Prioritize them (e.g., high priority to fix before next release vs. minor nice-to-haves).  
- **Proposed Iterations** – Based on the feedback, what changes will you make next? This could be tweaks to the UI, adding a help tooltip, fixing a workflow, or even rethinking a feature. Essentially, how will this feedback inform the next iteration of your product?  
- **User Quotes or Metrics** – *(Optional)* Include a couple of direct quotes from testers that are illustrative, and any relevant metrics from analytics during the test (e.g., “3 of 5 users dropped off at the profile setup step”). This adds credibility to your findings.

## 📑 Submission Requirements  
When you have completed the MVP Phase, compile your results into a clear submission. It should include:  

- **MVP Product Access:** Provide a way to access your MVP:
  - If web-based, a URL (and any login credentials if needed).
  - If mobile or local, a short video demo **and/or** the app package with installation instructions.
- **Documentation:** A document or slide deck that is well-structured and covers all the deliverables:
  - *Landing Page & Sign-up:* screenshot of the page and confirmation of how many sign-ups (if any) were captured.
  - *Architecture Design:* your system architecture diagram and tech stack outline.
  - *Wireframes & Flows:* images of your key wireframes and a summary of user flows.
  - *Core Features Implemented:* list and brief description of each feature in the MVP.
  - *Analytics Setup:* explanation of what’s being tracked and evidence (e.g., screenshot of analytics dashboard or code snippet of event tracking).
  - *User Testing Report:* summary of test plan, feedback, and what you plan to do next (as described in deliverables).
- **Team Contributions:** Clearly state each team member’s contributions in this phase (who did design, who coded which feature, who led testing, etc.). Transparency in teamwork is important.  
- **Presentation Quality:** Ensure the submission is **clear and visual**. Include screenshots, diagrams, and possibly short gifs or images from your MVP. Someone reading the submission should quickly grasp your MVP and results without needing to run the product themselves.  
- **Length & Format:** Follow any page or slide limits given by the course. If none specified, aim for brevity and clarity – make sure every item above is included, but avoid fluff. A logical flow (perhaps chronological through the steps) often works well.  

*(Submit all the above as instructed by the course – typically via the LMS. Double-check you’ve included everything to get full credit.)*

## 🏅 Grading Rubric (100 Points Total)  
Your MVP Phase will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

| Criteria                         | Excellent (20) | Good (15)            | Needs Work (10)          | Poor (5)            |
|----------------------------------|----------------|----------------------|--------------------------|---------------------|
| **Landing Page & Sign-up**       | Compelling landing page with clear value proposition; **sign-up form** fully functional; effectively captures user interest (many sign-ups or strong interest shown). | Has a landing page and sign-up form with mostly clear messaging; minor issues or design improvements needed. | Landing page or sign-up exists but is unclear or uninviting; functionality might be unreliable (e.g., sign-up not saving properly). | Little to no landing page present, or it’s very confusing; sign-up not provided or completely non-functional. |
| **System Architecture Design**   | Comprehensive architecture diagram covering all key components; tech stack choices are well-justified; design shows foresight for scalability and maintenance. | Architecture defined with major components identified; tech stack chosen but rationale is weak or missing some considerations; minor components not addressed. | Basic or incomplete architecture plan; missing important elements or unclear relationships; little thought to future scalability or technical risks. | No clear architecture diagram or plan; the technical approach is ad-hoc or not documented, indicating a lack of planning. |
| **Wireframes & User Flows**      | Detailed wireframes for all core screens; user flows are intuitive and cover primary use cases end-to-end; demonstrates strong understanding of UX (testers can navigate with ease). | Wireframes and flows provided for most key screens/use cases; generally understandable with a few usability issues or gaps in the flow. | Very minimal wireframing or flow design; missing screens or important steps, leading to confusion in how the user would use the MVP. | No meaningful wireframes or user flows created; team did not visually plan the user experience before development. |
| **MVP Functionality (Core Features)** | MVP is fully functional with all intended core features working correctly; delivers a cohesive experience that addresses the main user problem; few if any bugs. | MVP implements the majority of core features; might have some minor bugs or missing minor features, but still demonstrates the concept; partially addresses the problem. | MVP is partially functional; significant core features are missing or not working properly, limiting the ability to test the concept; buggy experience. | MVP is mostly non-functional or fails to include the basic features necessary to address the problem; quality is too poor to gather useful feedback. |
| **Analytics & User Testing**     | Analytics are thoroughly implemented (tracking key events/metrics); initial user testing conducted with actionable insights documented; team clearly iterated or has a plan to iterate based on feedback. | Basic analytics set up (tracking at least high-level usage); some user testing done (few users) with insights noted, though depth of analysis or follow-up actions could be stronger. | Minimal analytics (e.g., just page views) or poorly configured; user testing very limited (maybe one or two users or informal) with superficial observations; unclear how feedback will be incorporated. | No analytics instrumentation in the MVP; no evidence of real user testing or feedback collection before moving forward. |

*(Each criterion is scored out of 20. Scores will be totaled to determine your grade for this 100-point milestone. Ensure each area is addressed to maximize your score.)*

## 🛠️ Tools & Best Practices for Execution  
Completing the MVP phase efficiently requires good team coordination and project management. Here are some recommended tools and best practices to help your team stay on track and collaborate effectively:

- **Project Management:** Use a Kanban board or task tracker (e.g., Trello, Jira, Asana) to break down the MVP work into tasks. Track progress daily. This makes it visible what’s done and what’s in progress, helping the team manage time and scope.  
- **Agile Iteration:** Work in short sprints if possible. Set small weekly goals (e.g., “Sign-up form completed by week’s end”) and review progress regularly. Be ready to adjust tasks as you learn new information (for instance, if user testing reveals a needed change, slot it into the next sprint).  
- **Version Control:** Use GitHub or another version control system for your code. This enables multiple developers to work in parallel and ensures you have a history of changes. Do code reviews for key features to maintain quality, even if time is tight.  
- **Communication:** Keep team communication strong. Have brief daily stand-ups or check-ins to synchronize. Utilize team chat tools (Slack, Microsoft Teams) to discuss blockers or share updates asynchronously. Over-communicate rather than under-communicate, especially as you split up tasks like front-end, back-end, etc.  
- **Design Collaboration:** For wireframes and design, tools like Figma allow multiple team members to collaborate in real-time. This can speed up the design feedback cycle. Encourage non-designers on the team to comment on the Figma prototypes – everyone should understand the intended user experience.  
- **Testing & QA:** As features get built, test them immediately. It’s often helpful to have one team member act as a “tester” for a day, going through the whole user flow on the MVP and logging bugs/usability issues. Catching issues early makes the final user testing smoother.  
- **Scope Management:** Continually remind yourselves of the MVP’s goal: core features only. Use your backlog to note “nice-to-have” ideas that come up, but **defer them**. It’s easy to get sidetracked – a disciplined approach to scope will ensure you deliver on time.  
- **Documentation:** Maintain updated documentation as you go (architecture docs, API specs, etc.). This not only helps when writing the final report but also onboards any new team members or mentors who look at your project. Tools like Notion or Google Docs can be great for keeping all these notes in one place.  
- **Team Morale and Collaboration:** Celebrate small wins (finished a feature, squashed a tricky bug, got first sign-up!). The MVP phase can be intense – supporting each other and acknowledging progress keeps the team motivated. Regularly remind each other of the vision you’re working towards; it keeps the work purposeful.  

*(Using these tools and practices is not a graded requirement, but they will significantly improve your workflow and the quality of your output in this phase.)*

## 🎯 Final Note  
This phase is where your idea **comes to life**. It’s normal to hit roadblocks – technical issues, design dilemmas, user feedback that challenges your assumptions – but that’s all part of the journey. **Stay agile and open to change.** The purpose of an MVP is to learn and iterate quickly. If users struggle or a feature isn’t working as expected, treat it as invaluable feedback and adjust course. 

Keep execution lean and user-focused: **build, test, learn, repeat**. By the end of this phase, you won’t just have a prototype; you’ll have real users, real data, and a clearer direction for moving forward. Every bit of feedback and data you gather now will save you time and resources in the long run. 

📢 **Focus on delivering value, listen to your users, and be ready to iterate.** This is an exciting step towards building something truly impactful. Good luck, and have fun with it! 🚀
