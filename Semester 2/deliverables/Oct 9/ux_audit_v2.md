## How to Get Started

### 1. Conduct Heuristic Evaluation

**Go through your product and rate each Nielsen principle (1-5 scale):**

```
1. Visibility of System Status

- Is navigation intuitive based on real-world expectations?
- Examples to check: Icon meanings, button labels, menu organization

3. User Control and Freedom
- Can users undo actions or go back?
- Are there clear exits from unwanted states?
- Examples to check: Back buttons, undo functionality, clear exit paths

4. Consistency and Standards
- Are similar elements styled the same way?
- Do buttons, forms, and navigation work consistently?
- Examples to check: Button styles, form layouts, navigation patterns

5. Error Prevention
- Do you validate forms before submission?
- Are dangerous actions protected with confirmation?
- Examples to check: Form validation, confirmation dialogs, input constraints

6. Recognition Rather Than Recall
- Are important elements visible rather than hidden?
- Do users need to remember information from previous screens?
- Examples to check: Visible navigation, persistent information, clear labels

7. Flexibility and Efficiency of Use
- Are there shortcuts for experienced users?
- Can users customize their experience?
- Examples to check: Keyboard shortcuts, customization options, power user features

8. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design
- Is the interface clean and focused?
- Are you showing only essential information?
- Examples to check: Information hierarchy, white space usage, visual clutter

9. Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors

- Do you suggest solutions to problems?
- Examples to check: Error message clarity, recovery suggestions, help text

10. Help and Documentation
- Is help available when needed?
- Are instructions clear and actionable?
- Examples to check: Help sections, tooltips, onboarding guidance
```

### 2. Accessibility Audit

**Test your product for basic accessibility compliance:**

#### Keyboard Navigation Testing
```
Navigation Test:
- Can you navigate using only Tab/Enter/Arrow keys?
- Are focus indicators clearly visible?
- Can you access all interactive elements?
- Is the tab order logical and intuitive?

Testing Steps:
1. Disconnect your mouse/trackpad
2. Use only keyboard to navigate your entire app
3. Document any unreachable elements
4. Note poor or missing focus indicators
```

#### Visual Accessibility Testing
```
Color and Contrast:
- Use WebAIM Contrast Checker for all text
- Ensure 4.5:1 ratio for normal text, 3:1 for large text
- Test that you don't rely on color alone for information

Text and Zoom:
- Test readability at 200% zoom level
- Ensure text doesn't get cut off or overlap
- Check that all functionality remains available

Testing Steps:
1. Check all text/background color combinations
2. Zoom browser to 200% and test all pages
3. Use browser's high contrast mode
4. Test with different font size settings
```

#### Screen Reader Testing
```
Screen Reader Audit:
- Install NVDA (Windows) or use VoiceOver (Mac)
- Navigate your app using only audio feedback
- Ensure images, buttons, and forms have proper labels
- Test that content order makes sense when read aloud

Testing Steps:
1. Turn on screen reader with display off
2. Navigate through your main user flows
3. Note any confusing or missing information
4. Ensure all interactive elements are announced properly
```

### 3. Cross-Platform Testing

**Test your product across different devices and browsers:**

#### Device Testing Matrix
```
Mobile Devices:
- iPhone (different sizes: SE, standard, Plus/Pro)
- Android phones (different manufacturers and screen sizes)
- Test both portrait and landscape orientations

Tablets:
- iPad (different sizes)
- Android tablets
- Test touch interactions and gestures

Desktop Browsers:
- Chrome (Windows, Mac)
- Safari (Mac)
- Firefox (Windows, Mac)
- Edge (Windows)
```

#### Responsive Design Checklist
```
Layout Adaptation:
- Does layout adapt smoothly to different screen sizes?
- Are all features accessible on mobile?
- Do images and text scale appropriately?
- Are buttons and links easy to tap on mobile (44px minimum)?

Content Accessibility:
- Is text readable without horizontal scrolling?
- Are forms usable on small screens?
- Can users complete all main tasks on mobile?
- Do hover states work appropriately on touch devices?
```

### 4. Performance Evaluation

**Measure and assess speed and efficiency:**

#### Loading Performance
```
Speed Metrics (use Lighthouse or similar):
- Time to first contentful paint (aim for <1.5 seconds)
- Time to interactive (aim for <3 seconds)
- Largest contentful paint (aim for <2.5 seconds)

User Perception:
- Do you show loading indicators for slow operations?
- Are images optimized for web?
- Is initial page load fast enough to keep users engaged?
```

#### User Flow Efficiency
```
Task Completion Analysis:
- How many steps to complete main tasks?
- Are there unnecessary confirmation screens?
- Can users complete tasks without confusion?
- Do users get lost in navigation?

Efficiency Metrics:
- Time to complete key tasks (benchmark against competitors)
- Number of clicks/taps required
- Error rates in user flows
```

### 5. Error Handling Assessment

**Evaluate how your product handles problems:**

#### Error Prevention
```
Input Validation:
- Do forms validate input before submission?
- Are constraints clearly communicated?
- Do you prevent users from making errors when possible?

Dangerous Actions:
- Are destructive actions protected with confirmation?
- Can users easily undo or cancel actions?
- Are irreversible actions clearly marked?
```

#### Error Recovery
```
Error Messages:
- Are error messages written in plain language?
- Do they explain what went wrong and how to fix it?
- Are they displayed near the relevant form fields?

Recovery Paths:
- Can users easily fix errors without starting over?
- Are there clear paths back to working states?
- Do you preserve user input when errors occur?
```

## Evaluation Framework
