# Product Development v2

## What You Need to Deliver

A working implementation of your design_v2 features. Transform your wireframes and designs into functional code that solves the user problems you identified.

## Key Questions

- Have you implemented your key design_v2 features?
- Can you demonstrate working user flows?

## What You Need to Submit

### Implementation
- [ ] **Live app URL** or **APK/app file** that works
- [ ] **GitHub repository** with clear commit history showing:
  - Each feature implementation (separate commits)
  - Commit messages describing what was built
  - README.md with before/after screenshots
  - Technical decisions documented in commit messages

### Demo
- [ ] **5-minute video** uploaded to YouTube/Vimeo showing:
  - Key features working
  - User flows from start to finish
  - What problems you solved

## How to Get Started

### 1. Prioritize Your Implementation
Review your design_v2 and identify:
- Critical features that must be built
- User flows that need to work end-to-end
- Mobile requirements

### 2. Break Into Tasks & Commit Strategy
Create development tasks for each feature:
- Break designs into smaller components
- Make one commit per feature/component
- Write descriptive commit messages explaining what and why
- Focus on functionality first, polish later

### 3. Build Core User Flows
Ensure these work completely:
- Primary user journey (signup ‚Üí core action ‚Üí success)
- Key paths from your design_v2
- Error handling (what happens when things break?)

## GitHub Documentation Requirements

### README.md Template
```markdown
# [Project Name] v2

## Live Demo
- **URL:** [your-live-app-url]
- **Demo Video:** [youtube/vimeo-link]

## Grading Rubric

| Criteria | Excellent (4) | Good (3) | Satisfactory (2) | Needs Work (1) |
|----------|---------------|----------|------------------|----------------|
| **Feature Implementation** | All key features working flawlessly | Most features implemented and working | Basic features with minor issues | Incomplete or major issues |
| **Design Fidelity** | Closely matches design_v2 specs | Good match with minor deviations | Basic match to designs | Poor match or ignores designs |
| **User Flows** | All flows work end-to-end smoothly | Key flows work with minor issues | Basic flows functional | Flows broken or confusing |
| **Documentation & Demo** | Clear report with compelling demo | Good documentation and demo | Basic report and demo | Poor or missing docs/demo |

**Remember:** Focus on implementing what you designed. Better to have fewer features working well than many features working poorly.
