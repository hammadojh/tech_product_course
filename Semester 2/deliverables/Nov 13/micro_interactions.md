## How to Get Started

### 1. Understand Micro-interaction Principles

**What Makes a Good Micro-interaction:**
```
Purpose-Driven:
- Provides feedback on user actions
- Communicates system status
- Prevents or corrects errors
- Guides user attention
- Reinforces brand personality

Characteristics:
- Subtle and non-intrusive
- Quick (typically 200-500ms)
- Natural and expected
- Consistent across product
- Enhances usability, not just decoration
```

**The Four Parts of Every Micro-interaction:**
1. **Trigger:** What initiates the interaction (user action or system event)
2. **Rules:** What happens during the interaction
3. **Feedback:** How users know the interaction occurred
4. **Loops/Modes:** What happens over time or under different conditions

### 2. Identify Opportunities for Micro-interactions

**High-Impact Areas:**

**Button Interactions:**
- Hover states (color change, elevation)
- Active/pressed states
- Loading states with spinners or progress
- Success confirmation (checkmark animation)
- Error states (shake animation)

**Form Interactions:**
- Input field focus (border color, glow)
- Real-time validation feedback
- Character count indicators
- Password strength indicators
- Success/error messages with icons

**Navigation:**
- Menu open/close animations
- Active page/tab indicators
- Scroll progress indicators
- Breadcrumb transitions
- Modal slide-in/fade-in

**Loading States:**
- Skeleton screens for content loading
- Progress bars for long operations
- Spinner animations for quick loading
- Optimistic UI updates
- Loading state transitions

**Feedback & Confirmation:**
- Success toast notifications
- Error alerts that auto-dismiss
- Copy-to-clipboard confirmation
- Like/favorite animations
- Delete confirmations

### 3. Design Your Micro-interactions

**Button Hover & Click:**
```
Hover State:
- Background color change
- Slight elevation (2px shadow)
- Scale transform (1.02x)
- Timing: 150ms ease-out

Active State:
- Background color darker
- Reduced elevation
- Scale transform (0.98x)
- Timing: 100ms ease-in

Loading State:
- Disable pointer events
- Show spinner or progress
- Maintain button size
- Change text to "Loading..."
```

**Form Field Focus:**
```
Focus State:
- Border color change to primary color
- Border width increase (1px → 2px)
- Subtle glow/shadow (box-shadow)
- Label color change or animation
- Timing: 200ms ease-out

Validation Feedback:
- Success: Green border + checkmark icon (fade in)
- Error: Red border + error icon + shake animation
- Real-time: Validate on blur, not on every keystroke
- Timing: 300ms for feedback appearance
```

**Loading & Transitions:**
```
Skeleton Loading:
- Show content layout with grey placeholders
- Subtle shimmer animation across placeholders
- Timing: 1000ms linear, repeat infinitely
- Replace with real content smoothly

Page Transitions:
- Fade in new content (opacity 0 → 1)
- Stagger children animations (50ms delay each)
- Timing: 300ms ease-out
- Maintain scroll position
```

### 4. Animation Specifications

**Timing Guidelines:**
```
Quick Interactions (100-200ms):
- Button hover/press
- Checkbox/toggle
- Tooltip appearance
- Small icon changes

Standard Interactions (200-400ms):
- Input focus
- Dropdown open/close
- Card hover effects
- Tab switching

Longer Interactions (400-600ms):
- Page transitions
- Modal open/close
- Toast notifications
- Complex multi-step animations

Avoid: Animations >600ms feel slow
```

**Easing Functions:**
```
Ease-out (most common):
- Use for: Elements entering or appearing
- Feel: Starts fast, ends smoothly
- Example: Modals, dropdowns, notifications

Ease-in:
- Use for: Elements exiting or disappearing
- Feel: Starts slowly, accelerates
- Example: Closing modals, removing items

Ease-in-out:
- Use for: Elements moving position
- Feel: Smooth start and end
- Example: Repositioning, sliding drawers

Linear:
- Use for: Continuous animations
- Feel: Constant speed
- Example: Loading spinners, progress bars
```

### 5. Common Micro-interaction Patterns

**Button States:**
```
Primary Button:
Default → Hover → Active → Loading → Success
- Hover: Slight darken + elevation
- Active: Press down effect
- Loading: Show spinner, disable button
- Success: Brief checkmark before returning to default
```

**Form Validation:**
```
Input Field:
Empty → Typing → Valid → Submitted
- Empty: Neutral state
- Typing: Show character count or hints
- Valid: Green checkmark appears
- Error: Red border + shake + error message
```

**Notifications:**
```
Toast Pattern:
Hidden → Slide In → Display → Fade Out
- Slide in from top/bottom (300ms)
- Display for 3-5 seconds
- Fade out (200ms)
- Dismissible with close button or swipe
```

**Like/Favorite:**
```
Toggle Animation:
Inactive → Active → (Optional celebration)
- Icon fills with color
- Scale up briefly (1.2x) then back to 1x
- Optional: Particle burst or heart float animation
- Timing: 300ms total
```

**Drag and Drop:**
```
Interaction Flow:
Grab → Drag → Hover Over Drop Zone → Drop
- Grab: Element elevates, shadow increases
- Drag: Follow cursor smoothly
- Hover: Drop zone highlights
- Drop: Element animates to position
- Invalid drop: Snap back to original position
```

### 6. Implementation Guidelines

**CSS/Animation Best Practices:**
```css
/* Use transform and opacity for performance */
.button {
  transition: transform 200ms ease-out, 
              box-shadow 200ms ease-out;
}

.button:hover {
  transform: translateY(-2px);
  box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.15);
}

/* Use will-change sparingly */
.animated-element {
  will-change: transform, opacity;
}

/* Respect user preferences */
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  * {
    animation-duration: 0.01ms !important;
    transition-duration: 0.01ms !important;
  }
}
```

**JavaScript Animation Considerations:**
- Use CSS transitions when possible (better performance)
- Use JavaScript for complex timing or sequences
- Debounce/throttle scroll or resize listeners
- Clean up event listeners and timers
- Test performance on lower-end devices

### 7. Accessibility & User Preferences

**Accessible Animations:**
- Don't rely solely on animation to convey information
- Provide alternative feedback (text, icons, color)
- Ensure sufficient color contrast
- Make animations pausable if continuous
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` setting

**Reduced Motion:**
```
User Preference Support:
- Check prefers-reduced-motion media query
- Replace animations with instant state changes
- Maintain functionality without animation
- Still provide visual feedback, just without motion
```

### 8. Testing & Refinement

**Quality Checklist:**
- [ ] All animations run at 60fps
- [ ] Timing feels natural, not too fast or slow
- [ ] Animations enhance usability
- [ ] No janky or stuttering animations
- [ ] Works on mobile and desktop
- [ ] Respects reduced motion preferences
- [ ] Consistent across similar interactions
- [ ] Doesn't interfere with user tasks

**User Testing:**
- Does the interaction feel responsive?
- Do users understand the feedback?
- Are animations helpful or distracting?
- Do loading states reduce perceived wait time?
- Do users notice and appreciate the details?
