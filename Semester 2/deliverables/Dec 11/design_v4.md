| Criteria | Excellent (4) | Good (3) | Satisfactory (2) | Needs Work (1) |
|----------|---------------|----------|------------------|----------------|
| **Design Completeness** | All screens, states, and edge cases comprehensively designed (100+ screens) | Most screens and states designed with good coverage | Basic screens and states covered | Incomplete design coverage or missing key screens |
| **Visual Polish** | Pixel-perfect execution with exceptional attention to detail and professional quality | High polish with consistent execution | Good polish with some rough edges | Lacks polish or feels unfinished |

**Remember:** Design v4 is your final impression before launch. This is what investors will see in your pitch, what press will screenshot, and what your first 100+ users will experience. Every pixel matters. Every interaction should feel intentional. Every screen should look like it belongs to the same product family. This is where good products become great products—in the details, the polish, and the unwavering commitment to quality. Make it count.
