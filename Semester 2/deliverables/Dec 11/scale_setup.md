## How to Get Started

### 1. Load Testing & Capacity Planning

**Simulate Real Traffic:**
```
Load Testing Scenarios:
- Current load: 50 concurrent users
- Target load: 100 concurrent users
- Stress test: 200-300 concurrent users
- Spike test: Sudden 10x traffic increase

Key Metrics to Monitor:
- Response times (p50, p95, p99)
- Error rates
- Database query times
- CPU and memory usage
- Network bandwidth
- Request queue depth
```

**Load Testing Tools:**
- Artillery: Modern load testing toolkit
- k6: Developer-friendly load testing
- JMeter: Comprehensive testing suite
- Locust: Python-based load testing

**Capacity Planning:**
```
Calculate Resource Needs:
- Requests per second at 100 users
- Database connections required
- Memory per user session
- Storage growth rate
- Bandwidth requirements

Growth Projections:
- Week 1: 50 → 75 users
- Week 2: 75 → 100 users
- Week 3: 100 → 150 users (buffer)
```

### 2. Database Scaling Strategy

**Query Optimization:**
```
Performance Checks:
- [ ] All queries under 100ms
- [ ] Proper indexes on frequently queried columns
- [ ] N+1 queries eliminated
- [ ] Query result caching implemented
- [ ] Database connection pooling configured
- [ ] Slow query logging enabled

Optimization Techniques:
- Add composite indexes for multi-column queries
- Implement pagination for large result sets
- Use database-level aggregation
- Denormalize when necessary for read performance
- Archive old data to keep tables lean
```

**Vertical vs. Horizontal Scaling:**
```
Vertical Scaling (Upgrade Resources):
Pros: Simple, no code changes needed
Cons: Limited ceiling, single point of failure
When: Early stage, predictable growth

Horizontal Scaling (Add Servers):
Pros: Nearly unlimited capacity, redundancy
Cons: Complex, requires architecture changes
When: Rapid growth, high availability needs

Database-Specific:
- Read replicas for read-heavy workloads
- Sharding for massive datasets
- Managed database services (AWS RDS, Planet Scale)
```

**Database Best Practices:**
```
Configuration:
- [ ] Connection pooling (10-20 connections per instance)
- [ ] Query timeouts (5-10 seconds max)
- [ ] Automatic backups (daily minimum)
- [ ] Point-in-time recovery enabled
- [ ] Monitoring queries and slow logs

Maintenance:
- Regular index optimization
- Vacuum/analyze for query planner
- Monitor table bloat
- Archive old data
- Test restore procedures
```

### 3. Caching Strategy Implementation

**Multi-Level Caching:**

**Application-Level Cache:**
```
What to Cache:
- Database query results (5-60 minutes)
- Computed values (user aggregates, statistics)
- External API responses (10-60 minutes)
- Session data
- Frequently accessed configuration

Cache Tools:
- Redis: Fast in-memory cache with persistence
- Memcached: Simple distributed cache
- Application-level (in-memory for single instance)

Implementation:
- Set appropriate TTL (time-to-live)
- Implement cache invalidation strategy
- Use cache-aside pattern
- Monitor hit/miss ratios
- Handle cache failures gracefully
```

**CDN for Static Assets:**
```
Assets to CDN:
- Images and media files
- JavaScript and CSS bundles
- Fonts and icons
- Static HTML pages

CDN Providers:
- Cloudflare (free tier available)
- AWS CloudFront
- Vercel Edge Network
- Fastly

Benefits:
- Reduced server load (50-80%)
- Faster content delivery globally
- Better performance on slow connections
- Built-in DDoS protection
```

**HTTP Caching:**
```
Browser Cache Headers:
- Static assets: Cache-Control: max-age=31536000 (1 year)
- API responses: Cache-Control: max-age=300 (5 min)
- Dynamic content: Cache-Control: no-cache
- Use ETags for cache validation

Implementation:
Cache-Control: public, max-age=3600
ETag: "abc123"

```

### 4. Auto-Scaling Configuration

**Horizontal Auto-Scaling:**
```
Scaling Triggers:
- CPU usage > 70% for 5 minutes → scale up
- Memory usage > 80% → scale up
- Request queue depth > 10 → scale up
- CPU usage < 30% for 15 minutes → scale down

Configuration:
- Minimum instances: 2 (for redundancy)
- Maximum instances: 5-10 (budget dependent)
- Scaling cooldown: 5 minutes
- Health check: HTTP GET /health every 30s

Platforms with Auto-Scaling:
- AWS: ECS, Elastic Beanstalk, Lambda
- Google Cloud: App Engine, Cloud Run
- Heroku: Dyno autoscaling
- Railway: Auto-scaling (beta)
- Render: Auto-scaling plans
```

**Serverless for Variable Load:**
```
When to Use Serverless:
- API endpoints with variable traffic
- Background job processing
- Image processing or file operations
- Scheduled tasks (cron jobs)

Benefits:
- Automatic scaling to zero
- Pay only for actual usage
- No server management
- Built-in redundancy

Considerations:
- Cold start latency (100-500ms)
- Execution time limits (15 min max)
- Memory limits
- Not ideal for WebSockets or long connections
```

### 6. Deployment Automation

**CI/CD Pipeline:**
```
Automated Workflow:

2. Run automated tests (unit, integration)
3. Build application (compile, bundle)
4. Run security scans
5. Deploy to staging environment
6. Run smoke tests
7. Deploy to production (if tests pass)
8. Post-deployment health checks

Pipeline Tools:
- GitHub Actions (free for public repos)
- GitLab CI/CD
- CircleCI
- Vercel (automatic for frontend)
- Railway / Render (git-based deployment)
```

**Deployment Strategies:**
```
Zero-Downtime Deployment:
- Rolling deployment: Update instances one at a time
- Blue-green: Switch traffic to new version instantly
- Canary: Route small % of traffic to new version first

Rollback Strategy:
- Keep previous version deployable
- Automated rollback on health check failures
- Database migration rollback plan
- Feature flags for gradual rollout
```

**Deployment Checklist:**
```
Pre-Deployment:

- [ ] Performance metrics stable
- [ ] Monitor for 30 minutes
```

### 7. Cost Management

**Cost Optimization:**
```
Infrastructure Costs:
- Application hosting: $20-50/month
- Database: $15-30/month
- CDN: $0-10/month (often free tier)
- Monitoring: $0-20/month
- Total estimated: $50-150/month for 100 users

Cost per User:
- Current: $___/user/month
- Target: <$1/user/month at scale
- Break-even: ___ paying users

Optimization Strategies:
- Use free tiers effectively
- Reserved instances for predictable load
- Compress assets to reduce bandwidth
- Cache aggressively to reduce compute
- Archive old data to reduce storage
- Turn off dev/staging when not in use
```

**Scaling Economics:**
```
Cost Growth Projections:
- 50 users: $50/month = $1.00/user
- 100 users: $75/month = $0.75/user (improved efficiency)
- 500 users: $200/month = $0.40/user
- 1000 users: $350/month = $0.35/user

Key Insight: Costs per user decrease with scale
```

### 8. Disaster Recovery & Business Continuity

**Backup Strategy:**
```
What to Backup:
- [ ] Database (automated daily)
- [ ] User-uploaded files
- [ ] Configuration and environment variables
- [ ] Application code (version control)

Backup Schedule:
- Database: Daily automated, retain 30 days
- Files: Continuous sync to cloud storage
- Point-in-time recovery: Within last 7 days
- Test restores: Monthly

Storage:
- Off-site backup (different region)
- Encrypted backup files
- Versioned backups
- Automated backup verification
```

**Incident Response:**
```
Runbook for Common Issues:

Site Down:
1. Check status page / monitoring
2. Verify application health endpoints
3. Check database connectivity
4. Review recent deployments
5. Rollback if needed
6. Notify users via status page

Performance Degradation:
1. Check monitoring dashboards
2. Identify bottleneck (DB, API, etc.)
3. Scale resources if needed
4. Enable additional caching
5. Monitor improvement

Database Issues:
1. Check connection pool
2. Identify slow queries
3. Kill long-running queries if necessary
4. Add indexes if pattern detected
5. Scale database if resources maxed
```
