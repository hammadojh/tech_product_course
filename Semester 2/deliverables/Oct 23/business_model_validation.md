# Business Model Validation - Revenue & Market Viability

## What You Need to Deliver

A validated business model that proves your product can generate revenue and sustain growth. This deliverable moves beyond product validation to test your monetization strategy, pricing assumptions, and unit economics with real or simulated customer data.

## Key Questions

- Will people actually pay for your product?
- What pricing model works best for your target market?
- What are your unit economics (customer acquisition cost vs. lifetime value)?
- How will you acquire and retain paying customers?
- What is your path to profitability?
- Can your business model scale sustainably?

## What You Need to Submit

## How to Get Started

### 1. Define Your Revenue Model

**Choose Your Monetization Strategy:**

```
Common Revenue Models:
- Subscription (SaaS): Monthly/annual recurring revenue
- Freemium: Free tier with paid premium features
- One-time Purchase: Single payment for product access
- Usage-based: Pay per transaction/usage
- Marketplace: Commission on transactions
- Advertising: Revenue from ads
- Hybrid: Combination of multiple models
```

**Document Your Choice:**
- What revenue model fits your product best?
- Why is this model appropriate for your market?
- How does it align with customer expectations?
- What are the trade-offs of this model?

### 2. Develop Your Pricing Strategy

**Market Research:**
- Analyze competitor pricing (direct and indirect)
- Survey target customers on willingness to pay
- Understand price sensitivity in your market
- Research industry pricing benchmarks

**Pricing Considerations:**
```
Value-Based Pricing:
- What value does your product deliver?
- What pain does it solve or gain does it create?
- What are customers paying for alternatives?
- What would customers pay for this value?

Cost-Plus Pricing:
- What are your costs per customer?
- What margin do you need to be sustainable?
- How do costs change with scale?

Competitive Pricing:
- What do competitors charge?
- How does your value compare?
- Can you justify premium or discount pricing?
```

**Pricing Tiers (if applicable):**
- Free tier: What's included to attract users?
- Basic tier: Minimum viable paid offering
- Pro/Premium tier: Advanced features for power users
- Enterprise tier: Custom solutions for large customers

### 3. Calculate Unit Economics

**Key Metrics to Calculate:**

```
Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC):
CAC = (Marketing + Sales Costs) / Number of New Customers
- How much does it cost to acquire one customer?
- Include all marketing, advertising, sales costs
- Calculate for different channels separately

Lifetime Value (LTV):
LTV = (Average Revenue per User) × (Customer Lifetime)
- How much revenue does one customer generate over their lifetime?
- Consider monthly/annual subscription value
- Account for churn rate
- Include upsells and expansion revenue

LTV:CAC Ratio:
Healthy Ratio = 3:1 or higher
- Are you getting 3x+ value from each customer vs. acquisition cost?
- Lower ratio = unsustainable unit economics
- Higher ratio = opportunity to invest more in growth

Payback Period:
Payback = CAC / Monthly Recurring Revenue per Customer
- How long to recoup customer acquisition costs?
- Target: <12 months for SaaS businesses
- Shorter is better for cash flow
```

**Unit Economics Template:**
```
Example Calculation:
- Average Monthly Revenue per User: $25
- Customer Lifetime (1/churn rate): 24 months
- LTV = $25 × 24 = $600
- Customer Acquisition Cost: $150
- LTV:CAC Ratio = 600:150 = 4:1 ✓ (Healthy)
- Payback Period = $150 / $25 = 6 months ✓ (Good)
```

### 4. Test Your Monetization Strategy

**Validation Methods:**

**Real Monetization Testing (Ideal):**
- Launch paid tier to subset of users
- Implement payment system (Stripe, PayPal)
- Track conversion rates from free to paid
- Measure payment success rates
- Gather feedback on perceived value

**Pre-Sales Validation (at least):**
- Offer pre-orders or early bird discounts
- Create waitlist for paid features
- Conduct pricing surveys with target customers
- Test landing pages with pricing information
- Measure "purchase intent" signals

**Customer Interviews:**
```
Pricing Discovery Questions:
- "What would make this product worth paying for?"
- "What's a reasonable price for this solution?"
- "What would be too expensive?"
- "What would be suspiciously cheap?"
- "How does this compare to what you currently pay for alternatives?"
- "Would you pay [X] per month for this? Why or why not?"
```

### 5. Customer Segmentation & Value

**Identify Your Best Customers:**
- Which users derive the most value?
- Which users engage most frequently?
- Which users have highest willingness to pay?
- Which users have lowest acquisition cost?
- Which segments have best retention?

**Segment Analysis:**
```
Customer Segments:
1. [Segment Name]: Demographics, behaviors, value
   - Monthly value: $___
   - Acquisition cost: $___
   - Characteristics: ___
   
2. [Segment Name]: Demographics, behaviors, value
   - Monthly value: $___
   - Acquisition cost: $___
   - Characteristics: ___

Focus Strategy:
- Which segment should you prioritize?
- Why are they the most valuable?
- How do you acquire more of them?
```

### 6. Growth & Revenue Projections

**Create Realistic Forecasts:**

```
Revenue Projection Template:
Month 1-3 (Current):
- Active users: ___
- Paying customers: ___
- Average revenue per user: $___ 
- Monthly recurring revenue: $___
- Costs: $___
- Net: $___

Month 4-6 (Near-term):
- Expected user growth: ___
- Conversion rate to paid: ___%
- Projected MRR: $___
- Projected costs: $___
- Net: $___

Month 7-12 (Medium-term):
- User growth targets: ___
- MRR target: $___
- Break-even point: Month ___
- Key assumptions: ___
```

**Growth Assumptions:**
- User acquisition rate (organic + paid)
- Free-to-paid conversion rate
- Churn rate (monthly customer loss)
- Average revenue per user growth
- Cost structure changes with scale

### 7. Path to Profitability

**Financial Milestones:**
```
Break-Even Analysis:
Fixed Costs: $___/month (hosting, tools, overhead)
Variable Costs: $___/customer (support, infrastructure)
Revenue per Customer: $___/month
Break-Even Customers = Fixed Costs / (Revenue - Variable Costs)

Profitability Timeline:
- Month X: Achieve $X MRR
- Month Y: Break even on operations
- Month Z: Achieve profitability
- Year 1 Goal: $X ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue)
```

**Key Assumptions to Validate:**
- Are your user acquisition assumptions realistic?
- Is your pricing model sustainable?
- Can you maintain or improve unit economics at scale?
- What are the biggest risks to profitability?

## Grading Rubric

| Criteria | Excellent (4) | Good (3) | Satisfactory (2) | Needs Work (1) |
|----------|---------------|----------|------------------|----------------|
| **Revenue Model** | Clear, well-justified revenue model with competitive analysis and strong rationale | Good revenue model with reasonable justification | Basic revenue model defined | Unclear or unjustified revenue model |
| **Pricing Strategy** | Data-driven pricing validated with customers, competitive analysis, and clear value proposition | Good pricing strategy with some validation | Basic pricing established | Pricing appears arbitrary or untested |
| **Unit Economics** | Healthy unit economics (LTV:CAC >3:1) with detailed calculations and clear path to profitability | Reasonable unit economics with good analysis | Basic unit economics calculated | Poor unit economics or missing analysis |
| **Market Validation** | Strong evidence of willingness to pay from 10+ target customers or actual paying customers | Good validation with several customers | Some validation evidence | Limited or no validation of monetization |
| **Growth Projections** | Realistic, well-supported revenue projections with clear assumptions and sensitivity analysis | Good projections with reasonable assumptions | Basic projections provided | Unrealistic or poorly supported projections |

**Remember:** A great product without a sustainable business model is a hobby, not a business. Focus on validating that people will actually pay for your solution, and that you can acquire customers profitably. Understanding your unit economics early will guide your growth strategy and fundraising needs.
