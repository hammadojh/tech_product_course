## How to Get Started

### 1. Deep Dive into Your Analytics Data

**Use your Analytics Dashboard to understand real usage:**
- Which features are used most/least by your active users?
- How often do users return? (Daily, weekly, monthly active users)
- Where do users drop off in critical flows?
- How long do users spend in different parts of your product?
- Which user actions correlate with continued usage?

**Advanced Analytics Questions:**
```
User Engagement:
- What's your user retention curve? (Day 1, Day 7, Day 30)
- Which features predict long-term engagement?
- When do users typically churn and why?

Feature Performance:
- Which Product v2 features are actually being adopted?
- How do usage patterns differ between user segments?
- What features do power users vs. casual users prefer?

User Journey Analysis:
- What's the most common path through your product?
- Where do users get stuck or abandon tasks?
- Which entry points lead to the highest engagement?
```

### 2. Segment Your Users for Targeted Feedback

**Based on your analytics, identify user segments:**
- **Power Users:** High engagement, uses multiple features
- **Casual Users:** Infrequent usage, basic feature adoption
- **New Users:** Recently signed up, still learning the product
- **Churned Users:** Used to be active but stopped using

**Target different segments with appropriate feedback methods:**
- Power users: Deep interviews about advanced needs
- Casual users: Quick surveys about barriers to usage
- New users: Onboarding and first-impression feedback
- Churned users: Exit interviews to understand why they left

### 3. Choose Advanced Feedback Methods

**In-App Feedback Collection**
- Contextual surveys triggered by specific user actions
- Feature-specific feedback forms
- NPS surveys for overall satisfaction tracking

**Behavioral User Interviews**
- Screen-sharing sessions to watch actual usage
- Task-based testing of specific features
- Deep-dive interviews with your most engaged users

**Analytics-Informed Surveys**
- Target users who exhibit specific behaviors
- Ask about features they use vs. don't use
- Validate assumptions from your data

### 4. Combine Analytics with User Feedback

**Data-Driven Interview Questions:**
```
For Power Users (based on high engagement data):
- "I notice you use [feature X] daily. What would make it even better?"
- "You've been using this for [time period]. How has your usage evolved?"
- "What features are you still missing that would save you time?"

For Users with Drop-off Patterns:
- "I see you started [task] but didn't finish. What happened?"
- "What would make [specific flow] easier for you?"
- "At what point do you usually decide to stop using this?"

For Feature-Specific Feedback:
- "Analytics show only 20% of users try [feature]. Why do you think that is?"
- "You used [feature] once but never again. What was that experience like?"
```

## Examples by User Segment

### Power User Deep Dive
```
Analytics Context: User logs in daily, uses 5+ features, high session time

Interview Focus:
- Advanced feature needs and workflow optimization
- Integration requirements with other tools
- Willingness to pay for premium features
- Referral and advocacy potential

Sample Questions:
- "Walk me through your typical workflow in the app"
- "What would make you 10x more productive with this?"
- "What features would you pay extra for?"
- "Who else do you know who needs this?"
```

### Casual User Conversion
```
Analytics Context: Low frequency usage, limited feature adoption

Survey/Interview Focus:
- Barriers to regular usage
- Competing solutions and habits
- Motivation and trigger improvements
- Simplification opportunities

Sample Questions:
- "What prevents you from using this more often?"
- "How do you currently solve [problem] when you're not using our app?"
- "What would need to change for you to use this weekly?"
- "Which features feel overwhelming or unnecessary?"
```

### Churn Prevention
```
Analytics Context: Previously active users who haven't returned

Outreach Focus:
- Understand reasons for stopping usage
- Identify product gaps or competitive threats
- Test win-back strategies
- Validate retention features

Sample Questions:
- "What led you to stop using [product]?"
- "What would bring you back as a regular user?"
- "How are you solving [problem] now?"
- "What's one thing we could build that would make this essential for you?"
```

## Advanced Analytics Integration

### Correlation Analysis
**Combine user feedback themes with usage data:**
- Do users who request feature X actually use similar existing features?
- Are satisfaction ratings correlated with specific usage patterns?
- Which feedback themes predict churn vs. retention?

### Behavioral Cohort Analysis
**Track how feedback translates to behavior:**
- Users who gave positive feedback: Do they increase usage?
- Users who reported problems: Do they exhibit the problematic behavior in analytics?
- Feature requests: Do requesters actually use new features when built?

## Success Criteria

- Do you have 50+ users providing both usage data and qualitative feedback?
- Can you identify your most valuable user segments and their needs?
- Have you validated which Product v3 features to prioritize based on data + feedback?
- Do you understand your biggest retention and engagement opportunities?
