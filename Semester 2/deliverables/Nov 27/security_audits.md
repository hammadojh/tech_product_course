### 3. Input Validation & Injection Prevention

**SQL/NoSQL Injection:**
```
Prevention:

```

**Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
```
Prevention:

```
Prevention:
- [ ] CSRF tokens on all state-changing forms
- [ ] Validate tokens on server side
- [ ] Use SameSite cookie attribute
- [ ] Verify Origin/Referer headers

## Grading Rubric

| Criteria | Excellent (4) | Good (3) | Satisfactory (2) | Needs Work (1) |
|----------|---------------|----------|------------------|----------------|
| **Vulnerability Assessment** | Comprehensive security audit identifying all major vulnerabilities with clear severity ratings | Good vulnerability assessment covering most critical areas | Basic vulnerability identification | Limited or superficial security assessment |
| **Security Implementations** | All critical vulnerabilities fixed with strong security controls and best practices implemented | Most critical vulnerabilities addressed with good security measures | Some vulnerabilities fixed with basic security | Few fixes or weak security implementations |
| **Authentication & Data Protection** | Excellent authentication security, encryption, and data protection meeting industry standards | Good authentication and data protection with minor gaps | Basic security measures implemented | Weak authentication or data protection |
| **Testing & Validation** | Thorough penetration testing with automated scanning and manual verification | Good testing coverage with some manual validation | Basic automated scanning performed | Limited or no security testing |
| **Monitoring & Response** | Comprehensive logging, monitoring, and documented incident response plan | Good monitoring setup with basic incident response | Basic logging implemented | Poor or missing monitoring and response plan |

**Remember:** Security is not a one-time effort—it's an ongoing process. The cost of a security breach (financial, reputational, legal) far exceeds the cost of prevention. As you scale to more users, your security practices must scale with you. Protect your users' data as if your business depends on it—because it does.
