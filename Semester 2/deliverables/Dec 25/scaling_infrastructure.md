### 3. Database Scaling Strategy

**Scaling Progression:**

**Phase 1: Vertical Scaling (100-500 users)**
```
Strategy:
- Upgrade database instance size
- Optimize queries and add indexes
- Implement connection pooling
- Add read replica for reports

Actions:
- [ ] Database performance monitoring
- [ ] Slow query identification and optimization
- [ ] Index strategy review
- [ ] Query caching implementation

When to Upgrade: Query times >100ms or connections >70% capacity
```

**Phase 2: Read Replicas (500-2,500 users)**
```
Strategy:
- Primary for writes
- Replicas for reads (2-3)
- Route analytics to separate replica
- Implement eventual consistency pattern

Actions:
- [ ] Set up read replicas
- [ ] Application code changes for read/write split
- [ ] Monitor replication lag
- [ ] Load balance read queries

Cost Impact: +50% database costs
Performance Gain: 3-5x read capacity
```

**Phase 3: Sharding (2,500+ users)**
```
Strategy:
- Shard by user_id or tenant_id
- Geographic sharding if global
- Maintain sharding key consistency
- Cross-shard query optimization

Considerations:
- Complex to implement correctly
- Application code changes required
- Difficult to reverse
- Plan before implementation

Alternative: Use NewSQL database (CockroachDB, PlanetScale)
```

## Grading Rubric

| Criteria | Excellent (4) | Good (3) | Satisfactory (2) | Needs Work (1) |
|----------|---------------|----------|------------------|----------------|
| **Growth Planning** | Comprehensive growth model with clear stages, metrics, and realistic projections | Good growth planning with reasonable projections | Basic growth stages identified | Weak or unrealistic growth planning |
| **Technical Roadmap** | Detailed technical evolution plan with specific milestones and architectural decisions | Good technical roadmap with key improvements | Basic technical plans outlined | Vague or missing technical roadmap |
| **Cost & Economics** | Thorough cost analysis with unit economics showing path to profitability | Good cost projections with reasonable assumptions | Basic cost estimates | Poor or missing cost analysis |
| **Team & Operations** | Complete hiring and operational scaling plan aligned with growth stages | Good team scaling plan with key roles | Basic team planning | Weak or missing team/ops planning |
| **Risk Management** | Comprehensive risk assessment with detailed mitigation strategies | Good risk identification with mitigation plans | Basic risk awareness | Poor or missing risk management |

**Remember:** Scaling is a journey, not a destination. What got you to 100 users won't get you to 1,000. What works at 1,000 won't work at 10,000. Your infrastructure, team, and processes must evolve with your growth. The best founders plan for scale early but implement incrementally. Don't over-engineer for problems you don't have yet, but understand what's coming and be prepared. This is your roadmap from startup to scale-up. Execute it with discipline, adapt it with intelligence, and you'll build something that lasts. 🚀
