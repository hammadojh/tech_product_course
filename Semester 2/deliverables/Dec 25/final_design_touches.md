.button {
  transform: translateY(0);
  transition: transform 200ms ease-out;
}
.button:hover {
  transform: translateY(-2px);
}

/* Avoid - triggers layout */

  top: 0;
  transition: top 200ms;
}
.button:hover {
  top: -2px;
}
```

They show that you care about every pixel, every interaction, every moment of the user's experience. This is where craft meets code, where function meets beauty, where utility meets delight. These details won't show up in a feature list, but users will feel them in every interaction. That's what makes a product truly exceptional. ✨
