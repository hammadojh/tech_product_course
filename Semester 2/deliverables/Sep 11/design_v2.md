- [ ] Screen design specifications

### Demo
- [ ] Walk through design decisions in 5 minutes
- [ ] Show before/after comparison

## How to Get Started

### 1. Review & Analyze Feedback
**Look at your previous user testing:**
- What frustrated users most?
- Which features were confusing?
- What did users love?
- Where did they get stuck?

**Example Analysis:**
```
Key Issues Found:
- Users couldn't find the "Create" button (visibility problem)
- Checkout process took 5+ steps (too complex)
- Mobile experience was broken (responsive issue)
```

### 2. Refine Your Backlog
**Prioritize design improvements:**
- **High Impact + Low Effort:** Quick wins
- **High Impact + High Effort:** Major improvements
- **Low Impact:** Skip for now

**Example Prioritized Backlog:**
```
1. Fix mobile navigation (High Impact, Low Effort)
2. Simplify checkout flow (High Impact, High Effort)
3. Improve button visibility (High Impact, Low Effort)
4. Add loading states (Medium Impact, Low Effort)
```

### 3. Design Iteratively

#### Step 1: Low-Fidelity Wireframes
**Tools:** Figma, Sketch, or even paper
**Focus:** Information architecture and user flow

**Example Wireframe Process:**
```
1. Draw main screens with boxes and text
2. Show user flow from A to B
3. Test with 2-3 users
4. Iterate based on feedback
```

#### Step 2: High-Fidelity Designs
**Tools:** Figma, Adobe XD, Sketch
**Focus:** Visual design and interactions

**Example Screen Design:**
```
Key Screens to Design:
- Home/Dashboard screen
- Main user flow screens (3-5 screens)
- Mobile versions of key screens
- Error states and loading screens
```

## Examples by Problem Type

### Navigation Issues
**Problem:** Users can't find features
**Solution:** Clear navigation with labels and icons
**Design:** Bottom nav for mobile, sidebar for desktop

### Form Problems
**Problem:** Users abandon long forms
**Solution:** Multi-step forms with progress indicators
**Design:** Step 1/3, clear next buttons, save progress

### Mobile Issues
**Problem:** Desktop-only design
**Solution:** Mobile-first responsive design
**Design:** Touch-friendly buttons (44px min), readable text

## Success Criteria

- Can users complete tasks 80%+ of the time?
- Are your screens professional and polished?
- Do you have basic accessibility considerations?
- Do key screens work on mobile devices?
